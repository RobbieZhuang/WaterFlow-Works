a.

The workshop and appointments will be offered each term by the Pharmacy liaison librarian.

b.  Attend two Thesis Proposal defences by other students, prior to the students own oral defence.  

This course is only available for the first Thesis Proposal taken within the Pharmacy Program.  If a student is required to fulfill a second Thesis Proposal (for example, if being reassessed for transfer to the PhD) no additional course credit is available. 

The Thesis Proposal component involves the preparation of a written research proposal and oral defence of the proposal.  The intent is to learn how to use the literature to stimulate in-depth thinking about the basis of their thesis research project and to encourage development of their scientific oral presentation skills.  The thesis proposal should outline the reasons for undertaking the project, concisely survey the relevant literature, present a detailed description of the methodology to be used and outline any preliminary results acquired at the time of the proposal.  The written proposal will be considered by an examination committee that will normally comprise the students Advisory Committee plus an independent Chair who will assume that role for all thesis proposals within one academic term.  The full Examination Committee will independently grade the written proposal, and separately assign a grade to the oral defence. The simple average of those scores (two per committee member) will be the students grade for the course.', 'PHARM');

For roughly three centuries, until the suicide of the Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, the Egyptians lived under an alien ruling authority of Hellenic heritage.  Furthermore, they lived and worked alongside numerous immigrants of the same heritage, immigrants who appear to have benefited frequently from the differential laws, practices, and institutions that favoured them and did nothing for the native people of Egypt.  Yet at the same time, a study of Ptolemaic Egypt reveals also a pattern of increasing assimilation between Greeks and Egyptians. Such assimilation was not solely the result of increasing mutual tolerance and respect.  Indeed, the history of Greco-Macedonian relations with the Egyptians demonstrates that whatever respect and privileges the ruling classes ultimately granted to the natives of Egypt were at least in part the result of violent Egyptian assertiveness, in the form of armed rebellion.  The history of interactions between Greeks and Egyptians in Ptolemaic Egypt offers an unmatched opportunity for the examination of the relations between rulers and ruled, of the clash between ethnic groups, and of the forces that lead to reception on the one hand and resistance on the other.', 'CLAS');

The workshop and appointments will be offered each term by the Pharmacy liaison librarian.

b.  Attend two Thesis Proposal defences by other students, prior to the students own oral defence.  

This course is only available for the first Thesis Proposal taken within the Pharmacy Program.  If a student is required to fulfill a second Thesis Proposal (for example, if being assessed for internal transfer from the MSc to PhD program) no additional course credit is available. 

The Thesis Proposal component involves the preparation of a written research proposal and oral defence of the proposal.  The intent is to learn how to use the literature to stimulate in-depth thinking about the basis of their thesis research project and to encourage development of their scientific oral presentation skills.  The thesis proposal should outline the reasons for undertaking the project, concisely survey the relevant literature, present a detailed description of the methodology to be used and outline any preliminary results acquired at the time of the proposal.  The written proposal will be considered by an examination committee that will normally comprise the students Advisory Committee plus an independent Chair who will assume that role for all thesis proposals within one academic term.
